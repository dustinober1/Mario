## Overview

This project uses reinforcement learning to train an AI agent to play a version of the Mario game. The agent learns by interacting with the game environment, receiving rewards for making progress and penalties for mistakes. The model is built using Python and popular deep learning libraries.

## Files

- **mario.py**: The main Python script that contains the implementation of the game environment and reinforcement learning model.
- **requirements.txt**: A text file containing the required Python libraries to run the project.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries.

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dustinober1/mario.git
    cd mario
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

    You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To train the AI agent to play the Mario game, run the `mario.py` script:

```bash
python mario.py
```
The script will initialize the game environment, set up the reinforcement learning model, and begin the training process. The agent will start learning from scratch and gradually improve its performance over time.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the AI model, adding new features, or any other suggestions, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
